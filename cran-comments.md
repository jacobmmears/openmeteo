## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. Per review comments:

* The package description has been updated to include the API URL
* Documentation examples that make API calls have been wrapped in `\donttest` rather than `\dontrun`, avoiding brittleness. Automated tests instead use mock API responses via `httptest`.
