#' @description
#' `blsR` provides functions for retrieving and processing data from the BLS API.
#' The functions are divided into 5 categories: query generators, query requests,
#' the spanning functions, result processors, and the user-friendly simplified
#' interface.
#'
#' @section API Key and Definition:

#' The API key is an optional argument, but it is recommended you register for
#' an API key and use it. Requests without a key are limited to 10 years of data
#' per request, 25 series per query, and 25 queries per day. You can register at:
#'  <https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/>
